                                         <li> There are mainly two species of true camels: the Dromedary and the Bactrian. The Dromedary is found in the Middle East and is also called Arabian camel. They have a single hump on the back. The camels with two humps on their back are called Bactrian camels, and they are found in parts of central Asia.</li>

<li>There are no wild Dromedary camels as they have all been domesticated. The only species of camels found in the wild are Wild Bactrian camels. Australia has a population of feral camels that are descended from domesticated ancestors. 80% of camels in India are mostly in the desert region of Rajasthan.</li>

<li>Camels can survive in harsh environments. They can survive without food and water for long. It was believed that they store water but was later discovered to be a fat reserve. Fats are a more concentrated source of energy that allows camels to go for long periods of time without food.</li>

<li>Fully grown camels can be 3 metres in length and stand as tall as 2 metres at their hump. The Bactrian camels being the larger kind can weigh between 300 and 1000 kgs. The Dromedary camels weigh in between 300 and 600 kgs.</li>

<li>Camels can drink nearly 200 litres of water in one day. Camels have two lips which they can move independently to graze and eat leaves of thorny desert bushes without hurting themselves. They also have nostrils that they can open and shut whenever they want to stop the sand from entering their nose.</li>

                            <p>Interesting Facts About Chameleon
                            </center>
                                        <li>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.</li>

                                         <li> There are around 160 species of chameleon.</li>
                                          
                                          <li>Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.</li>
                                          
                                          <li>Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> Chameleons have amazing eyes. The bulging upper and lower eyelids are joined and the pupil peaks out from a pinhole sized gap.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> Chameleons actual eyesight is great they can see small insects 5-10 meters away. They can also see in both visible and ultraviolet light.</li>
                                          
                                         <li> Chameleons feed by ballistically projecting their tongues often over twice the length of their body to catch prey, forming a suction cup as it hits its target.</li>
                                          
                                          <li> The chameleons tongue can reach its prey in just 0.07 split seconds, with the projectile acceleration reaching over 41 g's of force.</li>
                                          
                                          <li> Chameleons usually eat large insects such as locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, and stick insects, some bigger species also eat other lizards and young birds.</li>
                                          
                                          <li>Chameleons are not deaf but they do not actually have ear openings.</li>
                                          
                                          <li> Many species of chameleon have horn-like bumps or crests on their heads.</li>
                                          
                                          <li>Species of chameleon can be as small as 15 mm (0.59 in) or as large as 69 cm (27 in)</li>

                            </center>
                            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>

                            <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</li>
                                          
                            <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
                                          
                            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
                                          
                            <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
                                          
                            <li>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li>
                                          
                            <li>They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</li>
                                          
                            <li>Their predators, or animals that will eat them, don’t know they’re coming. Lots of animals, including birds, mice and raccoons, are in for a bug surprise!</li>

                            <p>Intresting Facts About Pigeon
                            </center>
                                          <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
                                          <li> Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</li>
                                          <li>Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. Both sexes take turn incubating the eggs and both feed the chicks ‘pigeon milk’ – a special secretion from the lining of the crop which both sexes produce.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
                                          <li>Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc.</li>
                                          <li>Although pigeon droppings are seen by some as a problem in modern society, a few centuries ago pigeon guano was seen as extremely valuable. It was viewed as the best available fertiliser and armed guards would even stand by dovecotes (pigeon houses) to stop others taking the droppings.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
                                          <li>Pigeons are fed by many members of different religions including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs for spiritual reasons. Some older Sikhs will ceremoniously feed them in honour of Guru Gobind Singh, a high priest who was renowned as a friend to pigeons.</li>
